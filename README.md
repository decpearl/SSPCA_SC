Our proposed method learns the reduced dimensional dictionary and coeﬃcient matrices using the structural information as well as sparsity of data. Then, the aﬃnity matrix is constructed from inner product of the learned dictionary coeﬃcient vectors, which shows the correlation among data points.
The most important parameter, which denotes the number of the dicioanry atoms, is r.
